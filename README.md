# Compiled directory of JS includes for bebras tasks

This repository contains a static directory structure used in [Bebras tasks](https://github.com/France-ioi/bebras-tasks).

This would be usually considered bad (or outdated) practice, but it addresses a requirement: allow people who are not experts in JavaScript tools (who cannot install `npm`, `bower`, etc.) to have a development environment for Bebras tasks.

### TODO

- find a better solution?
- use proper name for task-pr and platform-pr
- make a small .html requiring all modules, to give an example of IDs for all
- package syntaxHighlighter 3.0.9
- package json3
- package recent versions of jquery and jquery-ui
- package minify versions of custom js (integrationAPI, etc.)
