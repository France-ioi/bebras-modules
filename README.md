# Compiled directory of JS includes for bebras tasks

This repository contains a static directory structure used in [Bebras tasks](https://github.com/France-ioi/bebras-tasks).

This would be usually considered bad (or outdated) practice, but it addresses a requirement: allow people who are not experts in JavaScript tools (who cannot install `npm`, `bower`, etc.) to have a development environment for Bebras tasks.

## Bundles

To optimise loading of files, this directory also contains bundles, which can be used in place of importing the corresponding JS files.

To define a bundle, you must, in `importModules*.js` :

* add how to import the bundle to `importableModules`
* add the list of modules this bundle includes in `bundledModules`

and then, include, in `gulpfile.js`, the list of files to include in this bundle.

The command
```
gulp bundles
```
will then generate all bundles into the subfolder `bundles/`.

While testing this feature, bundles are loaded by `importModules*.js` only if `window.useBundles` is `true`.

## Loaders

Some modules have different versions loaded at runtime, for instance depending on whether the browser supports responsive. A loader will package some modules into itself so they can be selectively imported at runtime through the usual importModules function.

There is currently only one loader, which can be regenerated by executing, in the `loaders/` folder,
```
node makeloader.js
```

## TODO

- find a better solution?
- use proper name for task-pr and platform-pr
- make a small .html requiring all modules, to give an example of IDs for all
- package syntaxHighlighter 3.0.9
- package json3
- package recent versions of jquery and jquery-ui
- package minify versions of custom js (integrationAPI, etc.)
