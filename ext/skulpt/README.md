# Skulpt

This folder contains compiled versions for the Skulpt library.

TODO : determine to which version each file corresponds, and whether `modifications.md` still reflects any manual modifications.

* `skulpt.quickAlgo_1.5.min.js` corresponds to the build of the `geoffreyhuck` branch of https://github.com/France-ioi/skulpt/
